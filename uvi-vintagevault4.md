# Breakdown of UVI Vintage Vault 4 Instruments to the Real Sampled Instruments

| UVI Virtual Instrument | Sampled / Inspiration | Image | Description | 
|------------------------|-----------------------|------|--------------|
| [Bit Zone](https://www.uvi.net/bit-zone) | Crumar Bit 99 | ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab7e2a64-d560-4caf-b0ef-1f05ff44ff78)|Bit Zone is inspired by the Italian-born Crumar Bit 99, an obscure digitally-controlled 6-voice polyphonic analog synth released in competition to the popular 6-voice analog synths coming out of Japan at the time. No slouch, this formidable synth was designed with 2 DCOs and 2 LFOs per-voice, per-voice CEM 3328 analog filters, and per-voice VCAs, making it exceptionally versatile.|
| [Emulation II+](https://www.uvi.net/emulation-ii-plus.html#instruments) |E-MU Emulator II |![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/828f675c-ebb0-4f79-ab80-d5c28d1f6af3)|Not 1 but 3 iconic sampler-synths from the '80s plus a massive lo-fi drum machine, the original officially licensed sounds plus tons of new ones, all recorded from the vintage hardware, available as individual instruments or in a multi capable of huge stacked sounds and inspiring 4+1 part phrases, we are extremely excited to present you with our most ambitious library yet: Emulation II+!|
|[Hybrid 6000](https://www.uvi.net/hybrid-6000)|Casio HT-6000|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db410022-0f3d-42b3-bf5e-29ac02c7d92a)|Hybrid 6000 delivers a surprisingly impressive palette of sounds made possible by a hidden gem from 1987, the HT-6000, a multitimbral 8-voice polyphonic analog synthesizer with 4 DCOs and discrete VCF, DCAs per-voice, and a wonderful analog chorus. While the DCOs shared waveforms, they could each utilize discrete tunings, velocity curves and DCA envelope settings allowing the creation of complex, moving timbres reminiscent of much more expensive analog synths of the time.|
|[Prime 8+](https://www.uvi.net/prime-8-plus)|Roland 808|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb91121f-05a7-4127-ae8b-76b2375f0194)|The most iconic and sought after drum machine in the world, genre-defining, used on countless hits, proving itself decade after decade, presented and represented time and time again in sample libraries, software and hardware emulations, we offer you our best-in-class take on this legendary beat machine.|
|[Program 24](https://www.uvi.net/program-24#instrument)|Solton Programmer 24 and SM100|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d7215bb-ed67-4b63-9f94-2340c6c9aa21)|Program 24 brings you the pure sound of '80s Italo Disco inspired by two wild synths nearly lost to time, the Solton Programmer 24 and SM100. The Programmer 24 is an unassuming 3-octave keyboard released in 1985, it contained everything necessary to produce complete arrangements, and real time performance features perfect for backing up the band. It sported a full 8-bit PCM drum section, analog bass and lead arpeggio with analog filters, violin, cello, and 3 flute voices (8', 4', 2'), a featured arranger, chord and pattern sequencers. To top it off, it had individual outputs for 8 drum parts and bass, full MIDI, and a tape interface for storage.|
|[PX Memories](https://www.uvi.net/px-memories)|Lintronics LAMM|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45375b8a-d383-4a53-8c07-4ad9c25e2299)|Iconic, renowned, and arguably one of the sweetest sounding and most powerful analog synthesizers, PX Memories takes a deep-dive into the Lintronics LAMM. Based on the last and most ambitious of its makes polyphonic synths before going bankrupt in 1987, its development seems to have been incomplete, with a reputation for unstable tuning and difficult system navigation, and a subsequent Plus model with only basic MIDI implementation.|
|[PX SunBox](https://www.uvi.net/px-sunbox)|JoMoX SunSun|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbd62920-fe45-4615-bc69-5a80ec33c806)|A feat of instrument design, the SunSyn is a fantastically complex-in-all-the-right-places labor of love from German synthmaker JoMoX. Released in 1999, it can be considered in simple terms as an 8-voice polyphonic analog/digital hybrid, or in a more adventurous way as 8 discrete modular mono synths. Each voice is outfitted with 2 true analog oscillators capable of saw, square, or pulse with PWM, and 2 guided digital oscillators with hundreds of waveforms and custom sample support.|
|[Super-7](https://www.uvi.net/super-7)|Roland MKS-7|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7294c845-aa34-4a0d-900f-023887a61567)|Super-7 delivers the unabashed sound of the '80s inspired by the MKS-7, an 8-voice rackmount synthesizer that combines the analog architecture of the famous 106 with PCM sounds from the 7o7 drum machine. In demand, often emulated, and a well loved instrument to this day, the 106 has been used widely by diverse artists ranging from pop legends Depeche Mode to the genre-defying Autechre. The sound is powerful and dynamic, capable of creating rich and charactered voices within modern productions or carrying entire tracks with its distinct, warm analog vibe.|
|[Beatbox Anthology 2](https://www.uvi.net/beatbox-anthology-ii.html)|Many|![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db487eef-98f9-4906-81f3-e9dd0bc87dd9)|An incredible collection of vintage, modern and customized drum machine sounds representing over 50 years of grooveboxes, beat machines, drum modules, synth drums and more, from analog to digital, mainstream to obscure, BeatBox Anthology 2 delivers them all in an extraordinarily versatile and easy-to-use percussion instrument. Explore the history of hardware drum synthesis while you design your own kits, layer different machine sounds together, and even create entirely new hybrids with precision envelopes and sample offsets, all with expertly recorded and exquisitely sliced samples that deliver the authentic and unmistakable sound of hardware.
